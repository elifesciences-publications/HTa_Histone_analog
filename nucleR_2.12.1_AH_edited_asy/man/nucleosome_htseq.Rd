\description{
Few reads from paired-ended MNase-seq experiment in S.cerevisiae where
mononucleosomes were sequenced
}
\details{
This data is obtained from MNase digested nucleosomal DNA and sequenced with
Illumina platform. Paired-ended reads where mapped to SacCer1 genome using
Bowtie, and imported to R using the package \code{ShortRead} and paired ends
where merged into a single range.

Reads were sorted by chromosome and starting position and only a few reads
from the starting positions of chromosome 1 are presented.
