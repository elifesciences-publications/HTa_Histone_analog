\description{
Some bases from S.cerevisiae tiling microarray where mononucleosomes were
sequenced and hybridizated with histone-free naked DNA. The intensity is the
normalized ratio between the intensities from nucleosomic and naked DNA.

\details{
Due to the difficulty of providing a raw file, this file has been
preprocessed. See details.

The raw .CEL files from Affymetrix S.Cerevisiae Tilling 1.0R Array (3
nucleosomal + 3 naked DNA) has been merged using package \code{Starr} and the
resulting \code{ExpressionSet} object has been passed to \code{processTilingArray}
function from this package as follows:

\code{processTilingArray(data, exprName, chrPAttern="Sc:Oct_2003;chr1", closeGaps=50)}

The first 8000bp of the chr1 have been saved as this example dataset.
